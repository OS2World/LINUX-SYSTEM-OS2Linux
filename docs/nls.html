<h1>OS/2 NLS API Differences</h1>

<p>The following describes the implementation differences between the OS2Linux
library and the real OS/2 NLS APIs.</p>

<p>These APIs are included in your application by including the following
definition in your application source file.</p>

<pre>
#define INCL_DOSNLS
</pre>

<h2>DosQueryCtryInfo</h2>
<pre>
APIRET APIENTRY DosQueryCtryInfo(ULONG cb, PCOUNTRYCODE pcc,
                                 PCOUNTRYINFO pci, PULONG pcbActual);
</pre>
<ul>
<li>This function is not supported and always returns ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DosQueryDBCSEnv</h2>
<pre>
APIRET APIENTRY DosQueryDBCSEnv(ULONG cb, PCOUNTRYCODE pcc, PCHAR pBuf);
</pre>
<ul>
<li>This function is not supported and always returns ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DosMapCase</h2>
<pre>
APIRET APIENTRY DosMapCase(ULONG cb, PCOUNTRYCODE pcc, PCHAR pch);
</pre>
<ul>
<li>This function is not supported and always returns ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DosQueryCollate</h2>
<pre>
APIRET APIENTRY DosQueryCollate(ULONG cb, PCOUNTRYCODE pcc, PCHAR pch,
                                 PULONG pcch);
</pre>
<ul>
<li>This function is not supported and always returns ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DosQueryCp</h2>
<pre>
APIRET APIENTRY DosQueryCp(ULONG cb, PULONG arCP, PULONG pcCP);
</pre>
<ul>
<li>This function is not supported and always returns ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DosSetProcessCp</h2>
<pre>
APIRET APIENTRY DosSetProcessCp(ULONG cp);
</pre>
<ul>
<li>This function is not supported and always returns ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.</li>
</ul>
