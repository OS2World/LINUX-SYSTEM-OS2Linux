<h1>OS/2 Date and Time API Differences</h1>

<p>The following describes the implementation differences between the OS2Linux
library and the real OS/2 date time APIs.</p>

<p>These APIs are included in your application by including the following
definition in your application source file.</p>

<pre>
#define INCL_DOSDATETIME
</pre>

<h2>DosGetDateTime</h2>
<pre>
APIRET APIENTRY DosGetDateTime(PDATETIME pdt);
</pre>
<ul>
<li>None.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DosSetDateTime</h2>
<pre>
APIRET APIENTRY DosSetDateTime(PDATETIME pdt);
</pre>
<ul>
<li>This function is not supported by user mode Linux and always
    returns ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED if the process is not owned by the
    superuser (root).</li>
<li>The input time is normalized in case any of the values are out of range.
This behavior is different than the original OS/2 API behavior which returned
the error ERROR_TS_DATETIME when values are out of range.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DosAsyncTimer</h2>
<pre>
APIRET APIENTRY DosAsyncTimer(ULONG msec, HSEM hsem, PHTIMER phtimer);
</pre>
<ul>
<li>It is not necessary to call <i>DosStopTimer</i> for this kind of timer.</li>
<li>A total of ten timers are available by default for the <i>DosAsyncTimer</i>
and <i>DosStartTimer</i> APIs. See the <i>os2linux.h</i> header file for more
information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DosStartTimer</h2>
<pre>
APIRET APIENTRY DosStartTimer(ULONG msec, HSEM hsem, PHTIMER phtimer);
</pre>
<ul>
<li>A total of ten timers are available by default for the <i>DosAsyncTimer</i>
and <i>DosStartTimer</i> APIs. See the <i>os2linux.h</i> header file for more
information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DosStopTimer</h2>
<pre>
APIRET APIENTRY DosStopTimer(HTIMER htimer);
</pre>
<ul>
<li>None.</li>
</ul>
