<h1>OS/2 Resources API Differences</h1>

<p>The following describes the implementation differences between the OS2Linux
library and the real OS/2 resources APIs.</p>

<p>These APIs are included in your application by including the following
definition in your application source file.</p>

<pre>
#define INCL_DOSRESOURCES
</pre>

<h2>DosGetResource</h2>
<pre>
APIRET APIENTRY DosGetResource(HMODULE hmod, ULONG idType, ULONG idName,
                               PPVOID ppb);
</pre>
<ul>
<li>This function is not supported and always returns ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DosFreeResource</h2>
<pre>
APIRET APIENTRY DosFreeResource(PVOID pb);
</pre>
<ul>
<li>This function is not supported and always returns ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DosQueryResourceSize</h2>
<pre>
APIRET APIENTRY DosQueryResourceSize(HMODULE hmod, ULONG idt, ULONG idn,
                                     PULONG pulsize);
</pre>
<ul>
<li>This function is not supported and always returns ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.</li>
</ul>
